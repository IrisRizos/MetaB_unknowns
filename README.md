# Exploring the realm of unknown taxonomic protist diversity: parasites in the spotlight

Exploration of unknown protist sequences across different metabarcoding datasets. 

The goal of this study was to:
* describe the overall proportion of protist sequences which are taxonomically unknown in metabarcoding studies
* identify protist lineages are “the most unknown”
* identify environments rich in unknown diversity ⇒ concentrate sampling efforts
* get a list of most abundant, community-representative and recurrent unknowns to be prioritized for identification

By:
* homogenising diverse metabarcoding datasets into a global dataset
* clustering the sequences of the global dataset together based on similarity with a Sequence Similarity Network
* exploring spatial and temporal distribution patterns of unknown sequence clusters
